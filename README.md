Objective-C SDK for The Eye Tribe Tracker
====

Introduction
----

This is the Objective-C reference implementation for The Eye Tribe Tracker and provides a simple Objective-C interface for communicating with the server through the open [TET API](http://dev.theeyetribe.com/api/). This allows developers to easily get started and focus their energy on creating innovative and immersive apps using our eye tracking technology. 

This implementation is simple of nature and wraps the [C++ SDK](https://github.com/EyeTribe/tet-cpp-client)

This version is to be considered _alpha_. Feedback and bug fix submissions are welcome.
